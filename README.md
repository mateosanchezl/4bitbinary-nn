# MLP from Scratch - Odd/Even Binary Classifier

This project demonstrates building a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch using only Pythonâ€™s `math` and `random` modules to classify binary numbers as **odd** or **even**. 

---

## Overview

This MLP is implemented from the ground up, covering:
- **Layers and Neurons**: Input, hidden, and output layers with custom-defined neurons.
- **Forward Propagation**: Simple dot products and sigmoid activation.
- **Backpropagation**: Error calculation and weight updates using gradient descent.
